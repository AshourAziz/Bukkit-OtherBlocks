Color and Data Values


There are two places you can specify an additional data value:

    In the drop:

    otherblocks:
        SAND:
            - tool: ALL
              drop: WOOL
              color: RED

    In the original block specifier:

    otherblocks:
        WOOL@RED:
            - tool: ALL
              drop: DIRT

The data values you are allowed to use depend on which block you are tying the data value to. Note that, if not listed here, you can always use the raw data values as given in the minecraft wiki (e.g. WOOL@14 and WOOL@RED give the same result).
