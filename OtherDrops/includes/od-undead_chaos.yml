#### Undead Chaos - config file by Zarius

## Warning: zombies/skeletons in this config multiply faster than they can be killed.  This is 
## controlled however by only occuring at night, see default "time:" just below, and by not
## multiplying when struck with a "holy" golden sword.

## I will be refining this config as time goes on to better balance it.

# This config could be good for a "theme night" of chaos :)

defaults:
    biomes: ALL
    worlds: ALL
    time: NIGHT 
    # weather: 
    # permissiongroup:
